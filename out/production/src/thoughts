--Ideas--
Units are spawned from structures, not summoned.
Units have some interesting abilities
Enchantments are a thing.  They spawn from a structure and fall when the structure is destroyed.
Land can be raised or fallen -- This makes for interesting maneuvering.

--Win Conditions--
Opponent controls no land.  Land is lost when units with a special effect cross over it.

--Different races, some swarm, some with stronger minions, etc...--
